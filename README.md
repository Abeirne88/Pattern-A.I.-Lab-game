Pattern Movement

Create a game in Unity where the goal in each level is for the Player to collect a 
set of items (e.g. jewels). Protecting each of these items should be a Non-Player 
Character (NPC) which is executing a patterned movement. Try and vary the 
pattern movement employed by NPCs to make it more difficult for the player to 
collect some of the items. Marks are allocated as follows:

• Game & Content – 40%

o The game has a structure.

▪ Start / End

▪ Reward System

o The level of difficulty increases over levels / time.

• Pattern Movements – 60%
