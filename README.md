# physics-lab-game
lab game showing physics and enemy A.I. pattern movement

Project Submission:
• Game Files – The Unity project should be submitted in full.
• PowerPoint Presentation – Students should submit their PowerPoint 
presentation (or similar) in .PPTX or .PDF format. 
▪ NB: It’s recommended that there are no more than 12 slides. 
• Presentation – Students are required to present their game in class. 
▪ Students will have 10 mins to present their work.

Description
The objective of the Game Physics project is to develop a 2D game utilizing the 
Unity3D game engine. Due to the creative nature of game development, the theme of 
the application is at the discretion of the student. However, it is recommended that 
students consider the impact of design choices within the context of physics. For 
example, ice, sand, or water themed environments will provide opportunity to engage 
with alternative physics materials therefore mimicking the real-world counterparts. The 
following section outlines the project requirements:

 Requirements
The 2D Game design should consists of:
• Character – A moveable player character, the character controller should 
implement physics mechanics. 
• Game Mechanics – The game mechanics should challenge the player to avoid 
traps/enemies as they progress.
• Levels – The game mechanics should be implemented across a minimum of two 
virtual worlds. 
The following provides an overview of the physics-based requirements of the 
application.
• Colliders - All projects should implement a combination of collider types.
The game should incorporate a combination of three or more core lab learning 
outcomes as per the list below:
• Triggers – Triggers can be utilized to trigger corresponding responses from the 
game world, examples of such include activating weapons or triggering traps. 
• Projectiles/Forces – The application of forces should be considered as a 
method to produce projectiles which target the player location. 
• Physics Materials – Materials can alter the movement and response within an 
game application, students should place an emphasis on utilizing friction based 
mechanics or bounce as an obstacle to challenge the player as they progress. 
• Joints – There are a number of joints which allow developers to engage with 
corresponding physics responses within the game world. Examples of such 
include friction, hinge, slider, and spring joints. These should be included were 
necessary to engage the player. 
• Effectors – There are numerous effectors which can be utilized to emulate 
physics. Students should consider the implementation of platform, surface, or 
buoyancy effectors in their application to replicate real world responses.


Lab:- Pattern Movement
Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will:
• Create an interactive demo in Unity
• Employ Chase and Evade Non-Player Character behaviours.
• Employ pattern movement behaviours
Lab Assessment
This Lab will be assessed at the end of next week’s Lab – week beginning the 
14th of March. Also, please demo your work to date at the end of this weeks 
lab.
Pattern Movement
Create a game in Unity where the goal in each level is for the Player to collect a 
set of items (e.g. jewels). Protecting each of these items should be a Non-Player 
Character (NPC) which is executing a patterned movement. Try and vary the 
pattern movement employed by NPCs to make it more difficult for the player to 
collect some of the items. Marks are allocated as follows:
• Game & Content – 40%
o The game has a structure.
▪ Start / End
▪ Reward System
o The level of difficulty increases over levels / time.
• Pattern Movements – 60%
